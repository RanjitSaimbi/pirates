                being like and the amazing characters we'd like to see in that
                future! We have worked really hard on this, so sit back and

                The very first Young Pirates of Langdon have travelled 1000
                years in the future to tell you about the funny, amazing, scary
                and weird futures we might find. On this website you will find a
                mixture of letters from the future and descriptions of
                futuristic characters.
                <br />
                <br />
                All our projects focus on the voice and perspective of our Young
                Pirates. We hope you enjoy this insight into their hopes, dreams
                and imaginings of the future. A salute to their hard work and to
                everyone who has supported them along the way.

                Hargreeves has black, smooth silky hair and blue eyes. He looks
                nothing like his siblings as he was adopted as a baby by Sir.
                Reginald Hargreeves. He wears dusty, old-looking full school
                uniform. His hair is as black as the night and his eyes are a
                dark pool of water full of curiosity. His school uniform looking
                very old and dusty. His life is full of mysteries. He is also a
                bit mysterious and doesn’t like to talk to people about his
                problems, he wants to solve them himself. He isn't very social,
                he is rude to strangers who speak to him. He is very brave and
                saves the world from an apocalypse, twice.
              </p>

              <p>
                He teleports in a blink of an eye, like a blinding blue flash.
                He can use his power to get out of a dilemma. He could teleport
                out of the place where the problem is or go back in the past to
                avoid it When my character uses his power, a blinding blue
                energetic light appears and zaps and when the light is gone, he
                disappears. He doesn’t normally teleport in front of people, and
                if he does, he does it in front on people who know about his
                power like his family or a secret organisation.
              </p>

              <p>
                He doesn’t like to socialise with other people that much. If he
                told them about his powers then they will get confused and just
                think he's weird. His backstory is that when he was a teen he
                said he wanted to time- travel but he was too young, so he got
                mad that he couldn’t. So, he time- travelled, but too far, so he
                got stuck in the future, which was destroyed and up in flames.
                He got stuck for more than 40 years and when he came back he was
                an old man stuck inside a teen’s body.

                Black Panther is a strong man who can throw anybody to the
                ground. Black Panther has sharp teeth like werewolves that can
                TEAR someone apart. He also wears a mask when he travels so no
                one can spot who he is or what his identity is. He is like a

                He wears a purple suit which glows in the dark like his mask.
                Black panther travels around the town to make sure everyone's
                safe like a ninja. The super ninja also has sharp claws like
                dinosaurs to scratch his enemies and has venom inside of them.
                You can also tell the enemies by the scratches on their faces.

                My character is really kind and he’s really helpful because he
                steals from the rich and gives it to the poor which is a good
                deed. The skills that he has is speed, agility, seeing in the
                dark. My person’s backstory is that he had a really rough time
                when he was a kid and his family were really poor. So, he had
                nothing until he became a superstar and a hero that saves
                people. Black Panther works in an industry with other people
                like Iron Man and Thor and others. Even though he likes to work
                on his own he likes getting comfort from them.

                Your eyes are blessed when you see spiderman in full gold and
                red. You can smell the gas from his suit when he flies (no he
                didn’t fart). The gas is produced as his shoes go on fire, as
                hot as the sun, and allows him to fly! He is very nice and
                caring and when he is in the middle of a fight, he makes sure
                everyone's fine (but not the enemy). He has a spider’s shot in
                the middle of the fight, so that it’s unexpected. He even has a
                spider in the middle of the chest, so that when he is in danger,
                he can sense it. Then his chest opens and the spiders jumps on
                his enemy’s heads and bites them with poison.
              </p>

              <p>
                You’re probably wondering, what is his back story? How did he
                turn into the magnificent spiderman? Well, he was once a little
                boy and his father had told him to go outside and play with his
                friends and as soon as he was there, he saw a spider and he
                decided to touch it. But as soon as he touched it, he realized
                he had messed up. The venom slivered in his veins. Then he
                realized. He was spiderman. The one and only strong, powerful
                spiderman.

                The elusive Ryker stands in a futuristic dimension wearing a
                deceptively simple black t-shirt and pants. Don't let this
                simple outfit fool you. He is not too brave but has a peculiar

                On the spot he can transform into a TITAN with super alien
                strength. He can use his 10 tails, that only he can use, because
                he is a master down on planet earth. Ryker's strength outdoes
                even his sensei's even though he is a 14-year-old teenager!
                Using the 10-tail and powerful rase Ngan move at the same time,
                he can create the mythical power of the 7 DEADLY SINS that can
                destroy anything in their path. He can also use his fire bend

                My iron woman is silver and blue. She has a backpack full of
                necessary items for an emergency. She has rocket shoes to fly in
                the air. She also has a blue light on her chest. She uses this
                light to help people know where she is. But at the same time,
                she doesn’t use the light because she doesn’t want enemies to
                see her. In a blink of an eye, she would set off her security
                alarm to alert her, that supervillains have been caught. This
                make the victim relieved that here is no criminal lurking around

                eventually led her to help others. As she recalls her past, one
                tear is falling down her face, but she wipes those tears away to
                continue her day saving others. Iron Woman makes sure they don’t

                Voker may look scary under his unusual face. However, you will
                be blown away by his amazing dark green curly hair and luscious
                pale skin. He wears a dark purple outfit so he can camouflage in
                the night. He has a one-of-a-kind silky black cape which is as
                dark as midnight which helps him become invisible in the enemy's
                eyes. His wand is called mystery because no-one can find a name
                for it. This unique object is overflowing with power, dotted
                with white and green which symbolising power, independence,
                heroicness, and adventurousness.
              </p>

                My character looks like the Joker and Voldemort combined.
                Voker’s hair is as green as outdated spinach. His face is as
                discombobulated as Shrek’s whole body. He seems evil and looks
                evil, but don't judge a book by its cover because you never know
                the nice guy may turn out to be bad.
              </p>

              <p>
                He has mind reading powers, and he can do magic but he also has
                a killer instinct so don't make him angry, even though he is
                very calm. He survives by living in a cave and hunts for his own
                food and has been VERY INDEPENDENT since he was little. His cave
                is spacious or so that’s what he thinks - he hunts every animal
                that come his way!
              </p>
              <p>
                He can be very nice but don't get on his bad side, if you do,
                you wouldn’t want to know. Most of the time he is nice by giving
                loads of things like knives.

                My character is known for an amazing power. He is standing in
                the mountains near his village. He looks something like Naruto,
                with the same power and blonde hair and he has the power to turn
                into an ant and into a giant. When he turns into a giant, he has
                different strengths with different powers and he is tall as 20
                double decker buses with spikey hair that is the color of the
                sun. He has Hyūga eyes of 42 different types: each eye is his
                level of rage, turning into wolf eyes when he’s furious.

                Narant is a very helpful character even to his enemies when they

                in the shape of a giant or ant so people won't be scared. He
                will be in 42 max rage mode if he is angry because someone died
                and when he is in the village, he will have a kind face even
                though he is angry. To his people he will be in a normal size,
                with the blue shining eye with cute spike blond hair. He will be
                able teleport, a skill that is known as the Flying Thunder God
                jitsu. His other amazing skill is duplicate jitsu - also known

                Itachi is standing still in the dusk sky looking down upon the
                people of the village with his claw like hand out of his robe.
                He is known as the best sharingan user and his eyes can make
                people stunned. This skill, which is called a genjutsu, can make
                them think they are in a different dimension. It can also make
                him dodge attacks which he can copy and use against them.
              </p>

              <p>
                Itachi can awaken his sharingan to a mangekyu which makes his
                abilities better and add two unique skills. One of them is
                called Amaterasu, which is a fire which only goes away once
                their opponents are dead. The second ability allows him to use
                the Susan: this half-human like statue, gives him a sword and a
                shield to attack and block. That’s not all when it comes to his
                abilities: he has a cowboy gun which had a burning hot
                flamethrower. He has teleportation materials, but he doesn’t
                just use them at will, only when necessary.
              </p>

              <p>
                Itachi is a loving brother to his brother who is Sasuke Uchiha.
                He is very caring to his family and wouldn’t let anyone hurt
                them and for the people who do, he will slaughter their
                existence.
              </p>
              <p>
                He is a tall sort of skinny man with shiny black straight hair
                on each both sides of his head. He wears a silky robe looking
                jacket which covers his mouth and on it there are crimson red
                clouds and when his power turns on, his eyes turns bright red
                with a star symbol on it.

                Her clothes are flaming red and when they fly their wings they

                Eren has the power to become a titan, after being injected when
                he was a baby by his father. His powers are extremely helpful
                for humanity. Though he contains the founder titan, he hasn't
                mastered all his skills because he doesn't have royal blood.
                However, Eren still fights back strong when it comes to his
                close-ones. Eren knows weak points of titans and uses that
                knowledge to defeat other titans in his titan form.
              </p>

              <p>
                Eren is a sweet character but has gone through a lot. His mother
                was eaten in front of him as well as his friends. As a result,
                when it comes to his mates and close ones he doesn’t hesitate
                and does whatever he can to help. However, he can get carried
                away when it comes to missions. He wants to be the one who
                protects others and not the other way around - he doesn’t like
                it when he's told what to do. He wants to have a main role in
                saving humanity and he does whatever he can to prove that he is
                capable of it.

                Eren Yeager is also known as the humanity saver. Just like
                everyone else he still has difficulties to overcome, but he
                tries his best. You might spot him when he turns into a 6 feet
                titan. Eren can order others to do things with his voice and
                contains a strength that others do not have. As a result, he has
                saved many lives as he sealed Wall Maria and saved many homes of
                naïve people.

                immediately that he is tall as a tree, with an almighty presence
                and as soon as you see his eyes you will never forget him. He
                never takes off his mask, which he wears even when sleeps . His

                with really pointy fingers which are coated with bits of really
                sticky spider webs. His eyes are sky blue. No one dares to look
                him the eye because he can find out all your information with
                just one look and can receive any data or messages from over 10

                At the Almighty Mountain, in the fierce night of chaotic war,
                you will find the troublesome shinobi called Madara. He might be
                evil, but he is deadlier and more omnipotent than his entire
                clan. Although he has a very abnormal muscular, unhuman like
                body, he can instantly make an earthquake with his speed-like
                abilities. When he defeats or murders his enemies he stares at
                them, reminding them that they failed to defeat his powers. His
                half-eyed robotic eyes would deflect his enemies' attacks, which
                would astonish his anonymous enemies. His mechanical face would
                scare other villagers and his robotic arm can destroy buildings
                in the nick of time.
              </p>

              <p>
                Madara is known for being the strongest clan leader of the
                Uchiha. However, he can teleport to his enemies in a blink of an
                eye. A while back, THE TIME had finally come for him to be
                reincarnated with the help of his bloodthirsty members. This
                also made many fellow leaders be in awe of him. Marada only
                wanted peace amongst other villages, until one of his brother
                was brutally murdered by one them. THIS made him develop the
                inevitable eye – a deadly weapon - called the mangekyo
                sharingan. This eye would be the most omnipotent eye in the
                Uchiha`s weapons amongst all the clans!

                that? That is why iron- lady won't do that. She is a very nice

                It’s the year 3021 and the planet’s only hope of being saved
                lies in the hands of a very strong human-mutant, who is robotic
                with his face being the only human part of him. When he
                shapeshifts, you’ll see him in his other forms of a titan:
                animals, aliens, and also a fast car. Despite his enemies
                attempts to destroy it, he can still access his favorite weapon,
                the plasma cannon. He is made from completely strong
                hydrochloric titanium. The hydrochloric acid can melt human skin
                and there is no-one who can take him apart except his own maker.

                Cycloptic illusions might not look it but he is really tough,
                but every person or superhero has a weak spot. This cyborg’s
                weak spot is facing hydrochloric acid, which is too strong for
                his hydrochloric titanium. One touch of this deadly acid and he
                will only have one hour to get into any alkaline mixture. He
                also makes sure that he does not have any titanium sticking out
                because if a villain gets in the hands of hydrochloric titanium,
                he will be done for!!!! He has no family so that the evil,
                vicious villains can’t threaten him in this way either.
              </p>

              <p>
                Mr. Cyborg can shapeshift into anything he wants, can use his
                plasma blaster to go through anything and even has a vehicle
                called the jumbo Lambo. He also has an anime sword, which has an
                ability called ‘Strike One, Slice One’. Despite this, he is a
                very calm and kind. This cyborg mutant has the most advanced
                technology that's ever existed and spidy senses that outdo even
                the most cunning of opponents!
